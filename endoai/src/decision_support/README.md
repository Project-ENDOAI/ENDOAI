# decision_support

This directory contains scripts and modules for decision support algorithms and utilities in ENDOAI.

## Purpose

The decision support modules are designed to assist in clinical decision-making by providing:
- Risk assessment based on patient data.
- Decision tree-based support systems for clinical workflows.
- Patient prioritization based on risk scores and other criteria.

## Modules Overview

- **risk_assessment.py**: Calculates risk scores for patients based on clinical data.
- **decision_tree_support.py**: Implements decision tree-based support systems.
- **patient_prioritization.py**: Prioritizes patients based on risk scores and other criteria.

## Guidelines

- Add new decision support modules as needed.
- Ensure all modules are well-documented and tested.
- Follow the project's coding standards and best practices.
