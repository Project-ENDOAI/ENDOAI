# preoperative

This folder contains code and resources for **preoperative planning** in the ENDOAI project.

## Purpose

- Preprocessing, segmentation, and analysis of preoperative imaging data (e.g., MRI, ultrasound).
- Scripts and modules for lesion detection, risk mapping, and data preparation before surgery.
- Utilities for data normalization, augmentation, and conversion.

## Structure

- `data_preparation.py` — Preprocessing and normalization of raw imaging data.
- `mri_segmentation.py` — MRI segmentation models and pipelines.
- `lesion_detection.py` — Lesion detection algorithms.
- `risk_mapping.py` — Risk mapping and visualization tools.
- Other scripts and modules related to preoperative workflows.

## Usage

Import modules as needed in your pipeline or run scripts directly for data processing and model training.

## Contributing

- Add new scripts or modules relevant to preoperative planning.
- Document all new files and functions.
- Follow the project’s [coding standards](../../../COPILOT.md).
