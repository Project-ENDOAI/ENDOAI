# intraoperative

This folder contains code and resources for **intraoperative (real-time) guidance** in the ENDOAI project.

## Purpose

- Real-time segmentation and analysis of surgical video or imaging data.
- Tools and models for intraoperative lesion detection, organ identification, and risk mapping.
- Utilities for integrating AI outputs into surgical workflows.

## Structure

- `video_segmentation.py` — Scripts and models for video-based segmentation.
- `lesion_detection.py` — Real-time lesion detection algorithms.
- Other scripts and modules related to intraoperative support.

## Usage

Import modules as needed in your workflow or run scripts directly for real-time inference and guidance.

## Contributing

- Add new scripts or modules relevant to intraoperative guidance.
- Document all new files and functions.
- Follow the project’s [coding standards](../../../COPILOT.md).
