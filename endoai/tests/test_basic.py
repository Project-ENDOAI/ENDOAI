# Suggestions for expanding your AI/ML toolkit and models:
#
# 1. Add the following libraries to your requirements.txt and environment:
#    - SimpleITK
#    - itk
#    - slicer (3D Slicer Python interface, optional)
#    - niftynet
#    - nibabel
#
# 2. For new model development, consider:
#    - Neural Networks (e.g., U-Net, ResNet, Swin-UNet) using MONAI or PyTorch.
#    - Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) for tabular or radiomics data.
#    - Bayesian Networks for probabilistic modeling and decision support.
#
# 3. Example: To start a new neural network model for segmentation, create a script in src/preoperative/ or src/intraoperative/ using MONAI or PyTorch.
#
# 4. Example: For gradient boosting, use scikit-learn, XGBoost, or LightGBM on extracted features.
#
# 5. Example: For Bayesian networks, consider using pgmpy or pomegranate libraries.
#
# 6. Add new tests for each model in endoai/tests/ (e.g., test_unet.py, test_xgboost.py).
#
# 7. For data loading and preprocessing, leverage SimpleITK, NiBabel, or MONAI transforms as appropriate for your modality.
#
# 8. For visualization and annotation, consider integrating with 3D Slicer or using MONAI's visualization utilities.
#
# 9. Document each new model and pipeline in the appropriate README.md and add usage examples.
#
# 10. For community datasets and examples, see the MONAI Model Zoo and 3D Slicer sample data.
