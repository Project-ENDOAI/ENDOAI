# .copilot

This directory contains configuration files and documentation for using AI assistance, such as GitHub Copilot, in the ENDOAI project.

## Purpose

The `.copilot` folder is used to:
- Provide guidelines for using AI tools effectively in the project.
- Document best practices for generating and managing code with AI assistance.
- Store project-specific configurations and workflows for AI tools.

## Structure

- **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**: A guide for maintaining and synchronizing the project folder structure with AI assistance.
- **RELATED_FILES.md**: Documents relationships between files in the project, such as imports, dependencies, and usage.
- **SYMBOLS.md**: Provides naming conventions and documentation standards for functions, classes, and variables.
- **PROBLEMS.md**: Explains how to handle and document problems (e.g., errors, warnings, test failures) in the project.
- **INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Additional instructions and preferences for using Copilot and other AI tools.

## Guidelines

- Follow the instructions in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to ensure consistency when generating or updating folders and files.
- Use clear and descriptive prompts when working with AI tools to avoid ambiguity.
- Regularly review and update this folder to reflect changes in AI workflows or project requirements.
- Reference `RELATED_FILES.md` to understand file dependencies and relationships.
- Use `SYMBOLS.md` to maintain consistent naming and documentation standards.
