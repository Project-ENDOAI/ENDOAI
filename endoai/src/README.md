# src

This directory contains the main source code modules for the ENDOAI project.

## Structure

- `preoperative/` — Scripts and modules for preoperative planning, imaging, and analysis.
- `intraoperative/` — Real-time guidance, segmentation, and intraoperative tools.
- `decision_support/` — Decision support algorithms and utilities.
- `reporting/` — Tools for generating reports and visualizations.

## Guidelines

- Organize code by workflow or domain (e.g., preoperative, intraoperative).
- Each subfolder should contain a `README.md` describing its purpose.
- Each Python package directory must include an `__init__.py`.
- Follow the project's [coding standards](../../../COPILOT.md).

## See Also

- [../README.md](../README.md) — Project-level documentation.
- [../../.copilot/](../../.copilot/) — Copilot/AI assistant configuration.
