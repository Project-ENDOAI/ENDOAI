# models

This directory contains model definitions, checkpoints, and related utilities for ENDOAI.

## Guidelines

- Store only model architecture code and configuration here.
- Do **not** commit large model weights or checkpoints (`.pth`, `.pt`, `.h5`, `.ckpt`, `.onnx`).
- Use the `checkpoints/` or `weights/` subfolders for storing large files locally (these are gitignored).
- Document each model and its intended use.
