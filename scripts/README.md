# scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts and automation tools for the ENDOAI project.

## Guidelines

- Place all project-related scripts (e.g., setup, automation, data processing) in this folder.
- Scripts should be well-documented and include usage instructions.
- Use Python 3.8+ for all Python scripts.
- Prefer cross-platform compatibility (avoid OS-specific code unless necessary).

## Usage

To run a Python script:
```bash
python scripts/<script_name>.py
```

To run the pre-commit hook manually:
```bash
bash scripts/pre-commit.sh
```

## Adding New Scripts

- Use descriptive names.
- Add a docstring or comment at the top explaining the script's purpose.
- Update this README with a short description of the new script.

- [../README.md](../README.md) for project overview and structure.
