# Visualization Utilities

This folder contains scripts and utilities for visualizing segmentation results and other outputs from the ENDOAI project.

## Scripts

- `view_results.py`  
  A script for visualizing segmentation predictions alongside the original images and ground truth labels.  
  Example usage:
  ```bash
  python view_results.py --image <path_to_image> --prediction <path_to_prediction> --label <path_to_label> --output-dir <output_directory>
  ```

## Purpose

The visualization utilities are designed to:
- Help analyze model predictions by overlaying them on the original images.
- Compare predictions with ground truth labels for validation and debugging.
- Save visualizations for documentation and reporting purposes.

## Output

Visualizations generated by these scripts are typically saved in the `output/visualizations/` directory. Use the `--output-dir` argument to specify a custom location.
